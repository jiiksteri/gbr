gbr - A single-glance git branch status viewer toy thing.
=====================================================


Shows your branch status with respect to matching branches in your
configured remotes. Think of it as a slightly confused git branch -v
with colors.

And yes, it would be completely doable with a bit of tooling on top of
command-line git, but I wanted to give libgit2 a spin and come up with
something useful (to mmmmeeee) as a side-effect.


Building
--------

Rrrriight, ok.

For libgit2 your best bet is building your own off the libgit2
repository and adjusting the Makefile here accordingly. Pick your
excuse between libgit2 moving too fast and your distro packagers
moving too slow.

After that it's just 'make'.

There is no install target, but do not worry. You can just copy/link
the gbr binary to your $HOME/bin or wherever and it'll work, provided
you either

 a) get rid of the -rpath trickery we have in the Makefile, or
 b) satisfy its expectations forever and ever

It's of course possible that you have a sanely packaged and recent
libgit2 and you can just set libgit2_CFLAGS and libgit2_LDFLAGS
using pkg-config in the makefile.

I don't.

Libgit2 is available at http://libgit2.github.com/
